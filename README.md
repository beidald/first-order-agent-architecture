# First-Order Agent Architecture: A Conceptual System Design and Failure Mode Analysis

## Overview

This repository hosts the conceptual design and analysis of **first-order agent architecture**, focusing on the **first-order essence** of agent systems.  
It provides a framework for understanding agent system states, architectural components, and potential failure modes, without relying on model training, benchmarks, or empirical performance claims.

The goal is to provide a **fundamental system-oriented perspective**, helping researchers and independent developers reason about agent behavior and system design from the **core properties** of the architecture.

## Contents

- `first-order-agent-architecture.pdf`: The final conceptual paper in PDF format, detailing the architecture and failure mode analysis.
- `figures/`: Optional architecture diagrams illustrating system components and interactions.
- `README.md`: This file, containing overview, usage, and citation information.
- `LICENSE`: Open source license file (MIT recommended).

## Key Concepts

- **First-Order Essence**: The core, invariant properties of an agent system that determine its behavior and architectural constraints.
- **System Architecture**: Components, interactions, and information flow in a conceptual agent framework.
- **Failure Modes**: Analysis of potential structural or operational failures, highlighting areas requiring careful design or monitoring.

## Usage

This repository is intended for **educational and conceptual reference**.  
You can download the PDF and diagrams to understand the design principles, explore failure mode analysis, and use the insights for research or prototyping of agent systems.
